# Robotarm_with_servomotors
I made Arduino robot arm with servomotors, project is still currently going on. So far I have designed the arm, 3D print it, built it and made some python testing code which I will launch here later on. Goal is to make robot arm tooltip controllable with playstation joystick(changes tooltip xy-values) and potentiometer(changes z-value, height) 
Here is physical outlook from it:

I designed it with Siemens SolidEdge software and 3d-printed it with ultimaker 3d-printer.
Here is some pictures from the designed parts in SolidEdge:
